This is a collection of GNU/Linux software tools to implement a virtual-reality system for biomedical research. It makes use of the [Blender Game Engine](http://www.blender.org) to drive an immersive spherical dome projection system (more information on [Paul Bourke's site](http://paulbourke.net/dome/); the dome projection mode was integrated into Blender by [Dalai Felinto](http://www.dalaifelinto.com/)).

See [GettingStarted](https://code.google.com/p/gnoom/wiki/GettingStarted) and [DomeProjection](https://code.google.com/p/gnoom/wiki/DomeProjection). A simple Blender game that can be controlled with two optical mice is available. I'd be happy to add electrophysiology, dome projection etc. if there's enough interest.

A [turnkey version](http://www.phenosys.com/images/pdf/PhenoSys_Flyer_JetBall.pdf) of the spherical dome projection system, based on [our design](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23396102), is commercially available from [PhenoSys](http://www.phenosys.com/index.php/en/products/virtual-reality).
